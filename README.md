# DOGM Engine

This is a Javascript implementation of a Dynamic Object Graph Mapper Engine.

## How to use DOGM Engine

#### 1. Install via npm or yarn:

#### 2. Define Schemas

We will be posting more documentation on schemas soon.

#### 3. Write code

Once you have schemas defined for your domain, all you have to do is write code using the Verbs and Nouns in your schema to build your application logic.

#### Browser support

To use DOGM Engine in a browser, you'll need to use a bundling tool such as Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, or Browserify. Some bundlers may require a bit of configuration, such as setting browser: true in rollup-plugin-resolve.
